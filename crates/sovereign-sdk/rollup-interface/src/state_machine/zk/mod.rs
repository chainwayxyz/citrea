//! Defines the traits that must be implemented by zkVMs. A zkVM like Risc0 consists of two components,
//! a "guest" and a "host". The guest is the zkVM program itself, and the host is the physical machine on
//! which the zkVM is running. Both the guest and the host are required to implement the [`Zkvm`] trait, in
//! addition to the specialized [`ZkvmGuest`] and [`ZkvmHost`] trait which is appropriate to that environment.
//!
//! For a detailed example showing how to implement these traits, see the
//! [risc0 adapter](https://github.com/Sovereign-Labs/sovereign-sdk/tree/main/adapters/risc0)
//! maintained by the Sovereign Labs team.
