# State Machine

This folder contains items that *may* interact with the state machine of the application.
This includes the SDK's core traits (DaApp, StateTransitionFunction, zkVM), serialization,
cryptographic data structures, etc.

Items in this folder are consensus critical, and should be modified only with appropriate care.
