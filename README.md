> [!WARNING]
> Citrea is still work-in-progress as a public devnet. While it's launched as a public devnet (on top of a custom Bitcoin Signet), it has not been audited and many features are under heavy development. Citrea's proper integration with [Bitcoin](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin) and [Clementine](https://github.com/chainwayxyz/clementine) is still ongoing. \

> Citrea uses **BTC** as its native token. **There's no Citrea token**. Please beware of scams! \

> Please also note that **BTC** and **cBTC** of Citrea Devnet does not carry any real value.

## What is Citrea?

Citrea is the first rollup that enhances the capabilities of Bitcoin blockspace with zero-knowledge technology, **making it possible to build everything on Bitcoin**.

Every transaction occuring on Citrea, is fully secured by zero-knowledge proofs and optimistically verified by Bitcoin via BitVM. The execution environment of Citrea is trustless with respect to Bitcoin and is accessible to all participants of the Bitcoin Network.

Citrea's vision is to build scalable infrastructure that advances Bitcoin into its next phase, foundation for world's finance. Citrea represents **Bitcoin Security at Scale** with its execution shard that keeps the settlement and data availability on-chain, on-Bitcoin.
