## What is Citrea?

Citrea is the first rollup that enhances the capabilities of Bitcoin blockspace with zero-knowledge technology, **making it possible to build everything on Bitcoin**.

Every transaction occuring on Citrea, is fully secured by zero-knowledge proofs and optimistically verified by Bitcoin via BitVM. The execution environment of Citrea is trustless with respect to Bitcoin and is accessible to all participants of the Bitcoin Network.

Citrea's vision is to build scalable infrastructure that advances Bitcoin into its next phase, foundation for world's finance. Citrea represents **Bitcoin Security at Scale** with its execution shard that keeps the settlement and data availability on-chain, on-Bitcoin.
