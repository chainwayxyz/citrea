/// over a Context, rollup developers can easily optimize their code for different environments
/// by simply swapping out the Context (and by extension, the Spec).

/// while a rollup running in an elliptic-curve based SNARK such as `Placeholder` from the =nil; foundation might
/// prefer a Pedersen hash. By using a generic Context and Spec, a rollup developer can trivially customize their
/// code for either (or both!) of these environments without touching their module implementations.
